## Course Description

This course gives an introduction to **Monte Carlo** and **stochastic approximation methods** with applications in machine learning. The focus is on **Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** methods used for sampling probabilistic models and **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** methods used for minimisation.
